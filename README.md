🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/username/IMAGEtoAnime.py.git
cd anime-avatar-generator

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Launch the App
python app.py


Gradio will launch a local web interface (and provide a shareable link if share=True is enabled in code).

🧠 How It Works

This app uses:

🧰 Diffusers by Hugging Face
: For Stable Diffusion pipelines

🎨 Counterfeit-V2.5 Model: Specialized for anime-style generation

🖼 Gradio: For building the web interface

🔧 Parameters Explained
Parameter	Mode	Description
Prompt	Both	Main text description or style enhancement
Gender	Both	Helps stylize face and pose (male/female prompt tuning)
Guidance Scale	Both	Higher = more prompt control, Lower = more randomness
Steps	Both	More steps = higher quality, but slower
Strength	Image-to-Anime	How much to transform the original image (0.3 to 0.9)
Seed	Both	Set for reproducibility. -1 = random every time
🧪 Tips for Best Results

Use expressive prompts: "bishoujo cyberpunk girl with glowing katana"

For photorealistic conversions, use lower strength (0.4–0.6)

For stronger anime style, raise strength and guidance scale

Use anime terms: shoujo, shonen, pastel, school uniform, sakura background
